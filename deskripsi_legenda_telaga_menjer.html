        <h1>The Legend of Menjer Lake</h1>
        <img src="telagamenjer.png" alt="Perang Obor">
        <p>Once upon a time, in an area in Wonosobo, precisely in Menjer village, there were two girls who were gathering food in the fields. Suddenly a very large crab appeared.  Both girls were amazed to see the giant crab. Until finally they forgot the advice of parents, which is if you see something strange or odd immediately leave the place or go home. However, one of the two girls approached the crab and rubbed the crab. While rubbing the crab's back, suddenly all the crabs in the surrounding area disappeared and where they stood guarded a large and deepening hole that resembled a well and carried the two girls. It became a well with an area of 70 ha and was later named telaga menjer. The shape gets smaller to the inside until it resembles a cone or trumpet shape. It is said that in the lake sometimes a giant fish of infinite size appears and sometimes it looks like someone is walking on the lake. This lake is attached between the villages of menjer, maron and tlogo. In the western part of the lake there is a large tree that blends with large rocks like a backrest and between the stones there is a hole like a door that is closed by 3 stones. If the stone is opened, we will see a spring in a tub-like indentation that is approximately 3mÂ² wide and local residents call it song kamal cave. Many people come to the cave to drink the water from the spring. It is said to cure various diseases, and if they see a high water level it is a sign of good things to come and if the water recedes it means it will get bad things or something to watch out for.</p>
