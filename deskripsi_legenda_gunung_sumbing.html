        <img src="gunungsumbing.jpg" alt="Perang Obor">
        <p>the name 'Sumbing' comes from the story of two twin boys. It is said that these two twins were often involved in arguments and fights. They always found reasons to argue and fight, until one day, their argument reached its peak. Their parents, who had long been frustrated and annoyed with their two children's behavior, finally decided to take decisive action. In a moment of high emotion, the father hit one of his children until his lip was torn. This incident later became the origin of the name 'Sumbing', which in Javanese means 'torn lip'.</p>
