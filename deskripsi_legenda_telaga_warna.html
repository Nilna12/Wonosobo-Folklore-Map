        <img src="telagawarna.jpg" alt="Perang Obor">
        <p>On the shores of Telaga Warna Lake lies the legend of the eternal love between a princess and a prince, who are told to be the colorful stones at the bottom of the lake. Princess Lestari and Prince Wibowo, two young people from different kingdoms, fall in love at first sight and promise to always be together. Their families oppose their love because of their different status and backgrounds. However, Putri Lestari and Prince Wibowo insist on staying together. As they planned to escape and live together, they were caught by royal soldiers and punished. Putri Lestari was turned into stones in the lake, while Prince Wibowo was thrown into prison. Prince Wibowo tries to find a way to change the curse and return Putri Lestari to human form. He received guidance from a wise man. By passing tests and collecting rare materials, Prince Wibowo managed to return Putri Lestari to human form, but with different skin colors. Putri Lestari and Prince Wibowo stayed together despite their different appearances. They live a happy life with the wisdom they gained from their journey. Telaga Warna Lake became a place full of their love and stories. Each colored stone at the bottom of the lake represents their eternal struggle and love.</p>
