        <p>It is said that there lived a family with two twins. Even though they were born as twins, these sons have 180 degrees opposite characters. One of them has a polite, polite and wise personality, while the other son is naughty and likes to cause trouble. As they grew older, the two children always fought until their father could no longer hold back his anger. Because he was at the limit of his patience, the father then punished his naughty son. Meanwhile, the other child is called Sindoro, which comes from the word ndoro, which means having a wise and polite personality.</p>
