        <h1>The Legend of Dreadlocks</h1>
        <img src="rambutgimbal.jpeg" alt="Perang Obor">
        <p>It is said that in the Dieng Plateau area, a leader ruled, namely Kya√¨ Kolodete, who had dreadlocks. He swore he would not shave his hair until the Dieng Plateau area was prosperous. If his wishes have not come true, he will pour his spirit into a child who has just been born or is just starting to walk. Until now, many children are born with dreadlocks and are believed to be the incarnation of Kyai Kolodete. They are still often found around the Dieng Plateau area.</p>
