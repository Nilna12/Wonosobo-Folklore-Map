        <h1>The Legend of Pengilon Lake</h1>
        <img src="telagapengilon.jpg" alt="Perang Obor">
        <p>It is said that in ancient times there lived a Queen who was famous as the ruler of the South Coast. The Queen had a very beautiful daughter who grew up. At that time her beauty was so famous that one day two handsome young knights came who intended to propose to the queen to be his wife. At that time, the Queen became very confused. Because she had to choose one of the two handsome knights to be chosen as her son-in-law. Then an idea came to the Queen to hold a competition to make a lake. Whoever makes the lake faster will be the one who will marry her daughter. Then the competition took place to compete for the daughter of the Queen. At the appointed time, the two knights competed to make a lake. Apparently the first knight was the one who managed to make the lake faster. By that knight he gave the name as Menjer lake. While the second knight made Pangilon lake. However, the second knight must be fair and admit that the first knight has the right to marry the Queen's daughter. Time went on and not two days after they were married, the Queen accompanied by her daughter escorted by royal soldiers came to the Dieng Mountains. When they arrived in the area which is now a nature reserve, they were amazed by the panorama and the beauty of Pangilon lake. So when the Queen's gaze fell on Pangilon Lake. She was so amazed and sought information on who had made the Pangilon lake. Then the Queen was told by her soldiers that the lake maker was the second knight who failed to participate in the competition to marry her daughter. While smiling broadly, Pangilon lake continued to be stared at by the Queen. Until she asked the royal guard to present her son-in-law or the first knight. With an angry look, the Queen immediately canceled the wedding plan between her daughter and the first knight. The Queen considered that the competition to make a lake was not only about speed. But also about beauty. Moreover, the Queen really likes beauty. The knight who did not accept because he felt he had been lied to did not accept. He tried to disturb the people of Samudra with his magic. The news reached the ears of the second knight. The first and second knights got into a fight. At the same time, the Queen's daughter was taken captive by the first knight. The Queen who saw the cheating of the first knight immediately complained to the gods. Until finally the first knight turned into a snake that could fly. Why did the Queen not keep her promise and change her mind? It is said, when the Queen and her daughter enjoyed Pangilon Lake, they were very impressed by the beauty and beauty of Pangilon Lake. In their hearts they compared between Telaga Menjer and Telaga Pangilon. Telaga Pangilon is more neatly made, the water is clear, sparkling, calm, peaceful and the waves are calm.  This is a reflection that the two knights who made this lake have a good nature and heart compared to Telaga Menjer, whose construction seems rough and the water is surging. This became the Queen's consideration to cancel the marriage with her son-in-law. Because they were very impressed with the beauty of the lake, the Queen and her daughter finally took a bath, tying their clothes to the trees around the area. Because the wind was so strong that it flew the Queen and her daughter's clothes to another lake and made the lake change color. The existence of history and what develops in the midst of the Dieng Community, Telaga or Pengilon Lake is considered a place for humans to introspect themselves by the lake.  Like Pengilon or Mirror in Javanese, it is said to be able to see the contents of the heart and the good and bad side of a person.</p>
